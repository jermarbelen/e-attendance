## ## Detailed ## ## - Cross domain feature:To enable cross-domain file selector, where files are hosted on one server (for example, serverA.com) and URL is being sent to another (for example, serverB.com), include crossdomain=1 in the URL.
For example, to instantiate image picker, use the following URL:http://serverA.com/[path to filemanager]/filemanager/dialog.php?type=1&field_id=fieldID&crossdomain=1
Then on serverB.com, the following code can be used to retrieve the URL after file selection is made. Please note, that the code is written for jQuery with FancyBox plug-in.

//
// Handles message from ResponsiveFilemanager
//
function OnMessage(e){
  var event = e.originalEvent;
   // Make sure the sender of the event is trusted
   if(event.data.sender === 'responsivefilemanager'){
      if(event.data.field_id){
      	var fieldID=event.data.field_id;
      	var url=event.data.url;
	$('#'+fieldID).val(url).trigger('change');
	$.fancybox.close();

	// Delete handler of the message from ResponsiveFilemanager
	$(window).off('message', OnMessage);
      }
   }
}

// Handler for a message from ResponsiveFilemanager
$(â€˜.opener-class).on('click',function(){
  $(window).on('message', OnMessage);
});


FILE MANAGER AS TINYMCE PLUG-IN
There is extra parameter needed filemanager_crossdomain when calling tinymce.init(), please see below.

   ...
   filemanager_crossdomain: true,
   external_filemanager_path:"http://path/secondaryserver/filemanager/",
    external_plugins: { "filemanager" : "http://path/secondaryserver/filemanager/plugin.min.js"},
   ...
});


- Convert_spaces options: enable the conversion of spaces to _ in file and folder name



## DATS 5.5.0


## ## Major ## ## - File permission changing
- Language Changing
- View/edit/create text files
- Fixes

NOTE: Changed upload button's icon!

## ## Detailed ## ## - File permission changing (OFF BY DEFAULT!)
	Now you can change the files/folders permission with a slick window.
	To access the window first you must activate it in the config file.
	After you activated it you can reach it from the rigth click menu.
	You can configure the permission with both text and checkboxes.
	If you entered a wrong format/number the initial state will be restored.
	When changing permissions for folders there will be more options for
	recursive changing (No/only files/only folders/both).
	If you set the permission wrong there will be errors.

	NOTE! If you don't know what you are doing then leave as it is bacause
	you can cause trouble.
	Usually files are 644 and folders are 755
	You CANNOT set the sticky bit!

- Language Changing
	You can now change the language dynamicly from the menu.
	The button is located next to the refresh button (a globe icon)
	
	If adding new language, it should be added to the languages.php file as 
	well for it to show up.
	
	I tried to identify all language codes and add the name on there own
	language but I might messed up so please check it and correct it if
	necessary. (Because I'm only a human and speak only 2 languages)

- View/edit/create text files
	You can now view/edit/create text based files like .txt.

	To view a file's content just click on the preview (eye) icon.
	To edit a file rigth click on it and select "Edit file's content"
	To create a new file just click on the "+ file" icon (old upload button)

	When creating a new file you must specify it's extension.
	All valid extensions for edit/create are listed in the config file
	($editable_text_file_exts)

- Fixes
	Fixed some css overflow errors
	Removed lang_View from menu because it was overflowing
	Removed hr.php lang because it's the same as hr_HR.php
	Changed upload buttons icon to accomodate the "new file" addition


## DATS 5.4.1


## ## Major ## ## - Security Access Keys
- More Tinymce settings
- Tinymce 3.## support
- Added image resize options
- Bugfixes


## ## Detailed ## ## - Security Access Keys
	If 'USE_ACCESS_KEYS' are set to true only those will access RF whose url
	contains the access key (akey)

	Allowed access keys are defined in the config as well.
	$access_keys must be an array so you can add multiple.
	Your access key should NEVER be 'key' and keep in mind they are CASE
	SENSITIVE!
	For recommended key generation read the comments in the config file.

	If there's no access key supplied with the url or it's not in the
	$access_key array you will get 'Access Denied' and you cannot continue.

	For tinymce a new variable was added: "filemanager_access_key"

	Tinymce config example:

	tinyinit
	...
	external_filemanager_path:"../filemanager",
	filemanager_access_key: "myPrivateKey",
	...

	This is a bit of additional security so no one can access your filesystem.
